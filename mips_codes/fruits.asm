# You went to the market to buy fruits. You buy x apples and y oranges.
# On the way back home, you ate 4 apples and 3 oranges,
# because you were too hungry and wanted to eat healthy.
# How many fruits do you have left?

# Take the value of x and y from console
# While entering the values, make sure x >= 4 and y >= 3. No need to check.
# Weâ€™ll learn if-else conditions later in the course!
